# FeedManager
A simple RSS feed manager/aggregator, similar to Feedly.
This project is, at this time, only ment to be used to play around with the Microsoft Orleans framework and the Actor Pattern.
It is not ment to be used, but who knows how things work out :-)

Additional playthings that got included are:
* MassTransit and RabbitMQ, to get some eventing in there.
* OpenTelemetry, to instrument applications.
* Jaeger and Prometheus, as per this reference: https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/tree/main/docker-compose/monitor
